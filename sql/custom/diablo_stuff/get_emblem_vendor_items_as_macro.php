/* This can output macros, that will help add items for vendors, that require Emblems, Tier tokens etc of higher monster level.
* i.e you want to add a vendor that sells all items that can be bought for Emblem of Frost on mlvl 10-20. This script will generate the files containing
* macros, with GM commands to add those items - one file per monster level. It makes it a lot quicker to make vendors.
* The script can also be used with monster level 1, so easy to make vendors that sell ALL Emblem of Frost items.
