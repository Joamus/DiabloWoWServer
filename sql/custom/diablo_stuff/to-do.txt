Emblem Items:

- Make Emblem of Frost etc in different mlvl versions
- Make ItemExtendedCost entries for all the items that normally have can be bought with Emblem of Frost



- REMEMBER: ItemExtendedCost.dbc has to be changed a new patch has to be made, if new currencies are added


Vehicle damage in dungeons:
- Make vehicle damage modifier for dungeons, so dungeons that require vehicles to do damage, now will do more damage the less people you are. 
Makes it possible to do 25 mans more easily with a few people.

Formula: damage * (dungeon_max_players/amount_of_group_members);


- Paragon:
Lifesteal 20/20
Healing 100
Offense 100
Defense 75/75



Paragon offense/defense
- Make two new paragon stats, that can give 50% damage/heal increase and 50% damage reduction. 1% should cost 100 paragon points
